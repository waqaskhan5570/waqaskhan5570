- 👋 Hi, I’m @waqaskhan5570, I have a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering
- I am a front-end developer with over 2 years of experience, and for the record, most of the repos here are just practice stuff or skill learning the real repos are either private or within organization repos but I guess that's obvious.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and AI
- I have experience working with Next.js, React, Redux, Docker, Cypress, Nodejs, Hasura, Graphql, Jira and UI libraries including Bootstrap, Ant design and Chakra UI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects
- 📫 you can contact me by my email: waqaskhan5570@gmail.com
