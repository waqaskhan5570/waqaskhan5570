- 👋 Hi, I’m @waqaskhan5570, I have a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering
- I am a front-end developer with almost 3 years of experience.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and AI
- I have experience working with Next.js, React, Redux, Docker, Cypress, Nodejs, Hasura, Graphql, Jira, and UI libraries including Bootstrap, Ant design, and Chakra UI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects
- 📫 you can contact me by my email: waqaskhan5570@gmail.com

- **Just for the record: The real code that I write is not usually in the public folders but rather private or in organization repos but I guess that's obvious**.
